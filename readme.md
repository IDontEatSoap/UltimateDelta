# Ultimate Delta

Delta 3D printers are underrated.

This project aims to develop a delta 3D printer that follow strict engineering principles:


1) Quality: The printer must outclass cheap I3 style printers, such as Ender 3's and Prusa's
2) Speed: The printer must print faster than cheap I3 style printers, such as Ender 3's and Prusa's
3) Materials: The printer must print 'durable' materials such as ABS, better than cheap I3 style printers, such as Ender 3's and Prusa's


The end goal is to make a Delta printer that is simpler then a Voron 2.4, with equal or superior printing quality, with simpler design and cheaper materials.
